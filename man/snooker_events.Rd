Data is taken from snooker.org (http://www.snooker.org/) API.

This data set has information about events that have all following qualities:
\itemize{
\item It has "Invitational", "Qualifying", or "Ranking" type.
\item It describes traditional snooker (not 6 Red or Power Snooker) between
individual players (not teams).
\item Both genders can take part (not only men or women).
\item Players of all ages can take part (not only seniors or under 21).
\item It is not "Shoot-Out" as those events are treated differently in
